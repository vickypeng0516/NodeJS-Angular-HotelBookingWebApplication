## Project description 

In this final project, we should build a site with angular/cli for the front-end and REST API for the back-end. We plan to design a website for traveller to find a hotel where they can stay the night, and for hotel manager to upload the information of their hotel to make more benefit. The traveller could also book more than one hotels at the same time and the information of all hotels could be viewed as an order. Plus, we have the third kind of user who is called the admin. The account and password of admin is granted by the system and the task of admin is to view and delete users (including traveller and hotel manager), hotels and orders information.
